PREFER guidelines are practices that you should follow. However, there may be circumstances where it makes sense to do otherwise. Just make sure you understand the full implications of ignoring the guideline when you do.

AVOID guidelines are the dual to “prefer”: stuff you shouldn’t do but where there may be good reasons to on rare occasions.

CONSIDER guidelines are practices that you might or might not want to follow, depending on circumstances, precedents, and your own preference.
